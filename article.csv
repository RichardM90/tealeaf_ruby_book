Google Error Leaks Website Owners' Personal Information,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/q22GASGE68A/google-error-leaks-website-owners-personal-information,"itwbennett writes: A Google software problem inadvertently exposed the names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers used to register websites after people had chosen to keep the information private.

The privacy breach involves whois, a database that contains contact information for people who've bought domain names. For privacy reasons, people can elect to make information private, often by paying an extra fee. But Craig Williams, senior technical leader for Cisco's Talos research group, discovered that the privacy settings for domain names registered through the company eNom were being turned off right at the time when the domains were up for renewal, starting around mid-2013. Williams contacted Google, and in about six days the privacy settings had been restored. In a notice, Google blamed a ""software defect."" Cisco said in a blog post that some 282,867 domains were affected.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

"In Historic Turn, CO2 Emissions Flatline In 2014, Even As Global Economy Grows",http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/qcaWTLZKoRI/in-historic-turn-co2-emissions-flatline-in-2014-even-as-global-economy-grows,"mdsolar sends this report from Forbes:
A key stumbling block in the effort to combat global warming has been the intimate link between greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth. When times are good and industries are thriving, global energy use traditionally increases and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions also go up. Only when economies stumble and businesses shutter &mdash; as during the most recent financial crisis &mdash; does energy use typically decline, in turn bringing down planet-warming emissions. But for the first time in nearly half a century, that synchrony between economic growth and energy-related emissions seems to have been broken, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency, prompting its chief economist to wonder if an important new pivot point has been reached &mdash; one that decouples economic vigor and carbon pollution. The IEA pegged carbon dioxide emissions for 2014 at 32.3 billion metric tons &mdash; essentially the same volume as 2013, even as the global economy grew at a rate of about 3 percent. Whether the disconnect is a mere fluke or a true harbinger of a paradigm shift is impossible to know. The IEA suggested that decreasing use of coal in China &mdash; and upticks in renewable electricity generation there using solar, wind and hydropower &mdash; could have contributed to the reversal.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

LAPD Police Claim Helicopters Stop Crimes Before They Happen,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/qDd-E4okPIo/lapd-police-claim-helicopters-stop-crimes-before-they-happen,"HughPickens.com writes True Angelenos don't even bother to look up when one of the LAPD's 17 helicopters rattles their windows searching for a car-jacked Camry or an assault suspect hiding under a jacaranda but few doubt that more bad guys would get away without the nation's largest police helicopter fleet to help chase them. Now the LA Times reports that data shows that LA's helicopters are stopping crimes before they happen. Tapping into the data-driven policing trend, the department uses heat maps, technology and years of statistics to identify crime ""hot spots."" Pilots then use their downtime to fly over them, on the theory that would-be criminals tend to rethink their nefarious plans when there's ""ghetto birds,"" as Ice Cube calls them, hovering overhead [explanatory video with annoying sound]. Months of data show that the number of serious crimes reported in the LAPD's Newton Division in South L.A. fell during weeks when the helicopters conducted more flights. During the week of Sept. 13, when the helicopter unit flew over Newton 65 times, the division recorded 90 crimes. A week later, the number of flights dropped to 40 and the number of reported crimes skyrocketed to 136, with rises seen among almost all types of crime, including burglary, car theft and thefts from vehicles. ""It's extremely cutting edge,"" says Capt. Gary Walters, who heads the LAPD's air support unit. ""It's different. It's nothing that we've ever done before with this specificity."" 

But Professor Geoffrey Alpert. a policing expert who has studied the use of police helicopters in Miami and Baltimore, says the choppers can deter crime in the short-term but criminals will likely return when they're not around (PDF). ""You are deterring the criminals but you aren't getting rid of them and their intent. Those criminals could strike in a different time and place,"" says Alpert. ""I mean that's the whole thing about random patrol. You see a police car and it's the same thing. You hide, he goes around the block and you go back to your breaking and entering.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Obama Administration Wants More Legal Power To Disrupt Botnets,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/KAA4wv1RdOQ/obama-administration-wants-more-legal-power-to-disrupt-botnets,"Trailrunner7 writes: The Obama administration has proposed an amendment to existing United Stated federal law that would give it a more powerful tool to go after botnets such as GameOver Zeus, Asprox and others. In recent years, Justice, along with private security firms and law enforcement agencies in Europe, have taken down various incarnations of a number of major botnets, including GameOver Zeus and Coreflood. These actions have had varying levels of success, with the GOZ takedown being perhaps the most effective, as it also had the effect of disrupting the infrastructure used by the CryptoLocker ransomware. In order to obtain an injunction in these cases, the government would need to sue the defendants in civil court and show that its suit is likely to succeed on its merits. ""The Administration's proposed amendment would add activities like the operation of a botnet to the list of offenses eligible for injunctive relief. Specifically, the amendment would permit the department to seek an injunction to prevent ongoing hacking violations in cases where 100 or more victim computers have been hacked. This numerical threshold focuses the injunctive authority on enjoining the creation, maintenance, operation, or use of a botnet, as well as other widespread attacks on computers using malicious software (such as ""ransomware"" ),"" assistant attorney general Leslie Caldwell wrote.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

According to his lawyer, Assange welcomes this, but Sweden still needs to be granted permission from both the UK and Ecuador.

In the private information section of the site's policy list, the company added that users ""may not post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent."" Twitter seemed to indicate that it would use some combination of automated and manual checks to decide whether a reported post is revenge porn or not before removing the post. ""We will ask a reporting user to verify that he or she is the individual in question in content alleged to be violating our policy and to confirm that the photo or video in question was posted without consent."" There will be an appeal process too. In February, reddit made a similar rules change after the site was embroiled in controversy for allowing the posting of stolen nude celebrity photos in 2014. Banning ""involuntary pornography,"" reddit urged victims to e-mail the site with details so administrators could remove the offending posts.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">
